The dungeon was made by monsters-reptilians near the abnormal river which often comes out of bridges.
That why dungeon is flooded all the time.
Monsters stay alive but heroes who decided to face the adventures are not.

Feeling the impunity reptilians started to terrorize the nearest lands.
But there were not enough soldiers to stop then.
You are the bravest person here was hired to save this lands.

The dungeon map is json-file.
Each location in this maze can be described by object which has
only one key "Location_<N>_tm<T>", N - location number,
T - time you spend moving to location.

This key contains the information about current location.
There can be mobs, bosses or next locations.

Mobs can be described by "Mob_exp<K>_tm<M>",
K - amount of exp that you receive killing this mob,
M - time you spend to kill mob.

The first location contains 2 locations and 1 mob.

The main goal to find out the hatch.
There is 123456.0987654321 seconds to find out it.

You can visit location only once and cant go back(you can move only forward).

You have to get at least 280 exp to open the hatch and escape the dungeon,
otherwise you will die and rise at first location(restarting game).

There is only one way to find out the hatch.

Good luck!
